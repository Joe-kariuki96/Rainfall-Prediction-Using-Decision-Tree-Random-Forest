# Introduction:
This report covers training and interpreting decision tree and random forest models for classification problems. It explores techniques to address overfitting through hyperparameter tuning and demonstrates how to make predictions on new data inputs using the trained models.

# methodology:

The report started by downloading a large Australian weather dataset with over 145,000 rows and 23 columns. Extensive data preparation steps were carried out, including creating training/validation/test splits, handling missing values, scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical variables.

After preparing the data, the report trained and evaluated decision tree and random forest models for predicting rainfall. It explored tuning hyperparameters like max_depth and max_leaf_nodes to reduce overfitting of decision trees. Random forests were shown to mitigate overfitting through ensembling. The impacts of varying hyperparameters like n_estimators, max_depth, max_features on random forest accuracy were analyzed. Finally, a function was provided to generate predictions on new data using the tuned random forest model.

# Results
The initial decision tree model suffered from severe overfitting. Tuning max_depth to 7 increased validation accuracy from 79% to 85% at the cost of lower training accuracy. The random forest model achieved 85.7% validation accuracy, a significant improvement over single decision trees. Increasing n_estimators from 100 to 500 provided a further accuracy boost. The optimally tuned random forest, with 500 estimators, max_depth of 30, and higher class weights, reached 85.6% validation accuracy compared to 84.5% with the best tuned decision tree.

# Conclusion
This report provided a comprehensive walkthrough of training decision tree and random forest models, addressing overfitting through hyperparameter tuning, and making predictions on new data. It highlighted the advantages of random forests over single decision trees and best practices for achieving high predictive performance through careful model configuration and tuning. The ability to effectively build, tune, and deploy tree-based models is crucial for solving machine learning problems.
